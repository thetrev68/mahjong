```

### AI Agent Capabilities

Each AI agent (players 1-3) possesses:

- **Hand Evaluation**: Analyzes current hand strength and potential
- **Tile Ranking**: Determines optimal tiles to discard
- **Strategic Planning**: Considers long-term hand development
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates opponent threats and opportunities
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies winning hand patterns
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Adjusts strategy based on game state

## ðŸŽ¯ AI Decision Making Process

### 1. Hand Analysis Engine

The AI continuously evaluates its hand using sophisticated algorithms:

```javascript
// Core hand analysis workflow
rankHandArray14(hand) {
    // Generate all possible winning hands
    // Calculate ranking scores
    // Determine optimal component formation
}
```

#### Hand Ranking Algorithm

1. **Component Analysis**: Breaks down hand into potential winning components
2. **Pattern Matching**: Compares against official mahjong patterns
3. **Score Calculation**: Assigns numerical rankings to possible hands
4. **Virtual Suit Mapping**: Handles flexible suit assignments
5. **Joker Optimization**: Maximizes joker utility

#### Key Features

- **Multi-Pattern Recognition**: Supports 100+ official hand patterns
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Real-time hand strength evaluation
- **Component Matching**: Identifies optimal tile groupings
- **Virtual Number Handling**: Manages consecutive number patterns

### 2. Tile Ranking System

The AI uses a sophisticated tile ranking system to determine discard priorities:

```javascript
rankTiles14(hand) {
    // Evaluate each tile's impact on hand strength
    // Calculate ranking scores
    // Sort tiles by strategic importance
}
```

#### Ranking Methodology

1. **Impact Analysis**: Measures each tile's contribution to winning potential
2. **Delta Calculation**: Compares hand strength with/without each tile
3. **Weighting System**: Higher weights for tiles in high-ranking hands
4. **Risk Assessment**: Considers defensive implications of discards

#### Strategic Considerations

- **Offensive Priority**: Favors tiles that advance winning potential
- **Defensive Awareness**: Avoids discarding tiles that help opponents
- **Pattern Flexibility**: Maintains multiple winning possibilities
- **Joker Management**: Optimizes joker placement and usage

### 3. Strategic Decision Making

The AI makes informed decisions at each game phase:

#### Turn Decision Process

1. **Mahjong Check**: Immediate victory detection
2. **Joker Exchange**: Evaluate automatic joker exchanges
3. **Discard Selection**: Choose optimal tile to discard
4. **Exposure Assessment**: Determine if claiming discards is beneficial

#### Decision Factors

- **Hand Strength**: Current winning potential
- **Wall State**: Remaining tiles and probabilities
- **Opponent Analysis**: Predicted opponent hands and strategies
- **Risk-Reward Balance**: Probability of improvement vs. safety

### 4. Charleston Strategy

During the Charleston phase, AI agents employ strategic tile passing:

```javascript
charlestonPass(player) {
    // Analyze current hand
    // Identify least valuable tiles
    // Consider opponent weaknesses
    // Execute optimal pass strategy
}
```

#### Charleston Algorithm

1. **Tile Evaluation**: Ranks all tiles by strategic value
2. **Pass Optimization**: Selects 3 tiles that minimally harm hand strength
3. **Opponent Modeling**: Predicts opponent preferences and weaknesses
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Avoids passing potentially useful tiles

#### Strategic Principles

- **Hand Preservation**: Maintain maximum winning potential
- **Pattern Development**: Support preferred winning patterns
- **Opponent Disruption**: Avoid strengthening opponent hands
- **Flexibility Maintenance**: Keep multiple strategic options open

### 5. Courtesy Vote System

AI agents intelligently participate in courtesy voting:

```javascript
courtesyVote(player) {
    // Assess current hand strength
    // Determine optimal courtesy count
    // Balance improvement vs. disruption risk
}
```

#### Voting Logic

- **Strong Hands (70+ rank)**: Vote for 0 tiles (no courtesy)
- **Moderate Hands (50-70 rank)**: Vote for 1-2 tiles
- **Weak Hands (<50 rank)**: Vote for maximum 3 tiles
- **Strategic Considerations**: Opponent hand strength assessment

### 6. Exposure Management

The AI makes strategic decisions about claiming discarded tiles:

```javascript
claimDiscard(player, discardTile) {
    // Evaluate discard tile value
    // Assess component formation potential
    // Calculate hand improvement probability
    // Determine optimal claim decision
}
```

#### Exposure Decision Factors

1. **Immediate Benefit**: Component formation opportunities
2. **Hand Completion**: Mahjong potential improvement
3. **Pattern Compatibility**: Alignment with current strategy
4. **Defensive Considerations**: Preventing opponent benefits

## ðŸ§  Advanced AI Features

- **Singles and Pairs**: Basic hand building blocks
- **Consecutive Numbers**: Sequential tile combinations
- **Like Numbers**: Same numbers across suits
- **Special Patterns**: Winds, Dragons, Lucky combinations
- **Complex Formations**: Multi-component winning hands

### 2. Joker Optimization

Intelligent joker management is crucial:

```javascript
exchangeTilesForJokers(currPlayer, hand) {
    // Identify optimal joker exchanges
    // Calculate hand improvement potential
    // Execute beneficial swaps
}
```

#### Joker Strategies

- **Component Completion**: Use jokers to complete sets
- **Hand Flexibility**: Maintain multiple pattern options
- **Risk Assessment**: Avoid risky joker placements
- **Timing Optimization**: Execute exchanges when most beneficial

### 3. Defensive AI

The AI employs defensive strategies:
